# liveGnuplot
plotting slow daily data to gnuplot displays in real time. 

This code is a Perl wrapper around gnuplot, that displays multiple daily graphs of recent real-time data, updating continuously. The visualization makes it easy to compare, for instance, the last week's daily temperature curves. 

A tool to scrape parameter data from MQTT topics and store in compatible log files is included.
